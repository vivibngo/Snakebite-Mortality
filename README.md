# Snakebite-Mortality
Gopalakrishnan and colleagues (2022) attempted to build a model to predict mortality from snakebite based on predictors that could be measured within 48 hours of admission to a hospital or clinic.

The viper_train dataset on Canvas contains information about 239 patients from southern India who were diagnosed with having been poisoned by a viper bite. These patients were used to fit their model. The viper_test dataset on Canvas contains the same information about a separate set of 140 patients, who were used to validate the model. Please see the viper_dictionary file on Canvas for an explanation of each of the variables.
